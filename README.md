# Solar Powered Low-Cost Cargo Delivery Drone - Software Development

## Project Overview

This repository contains the software development for a **solar-powered, low-cost cargo delivery drone**. The drone will autonomously navigate, manage its power consumption, and handle payload delivery. It aims to provide a sustainable logistics solution for last-mile delivery using solar energy.

The hardware components will be developed by a separate team, while this repository focuses entirely on the software side, including flight control, navigation, telemetry, and cargo handling.

## Software Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Path planning and GPS-based navigation for efficient cargo delivery.
- **Flight Control Integration**: Communication with the drone's flight controller (e.g., ArduPilot or PX4).
- **Power Management**: Monitor battery levels and optimize energy consumption using real-time telemetry.
- **Payload Management**: Control payload delivery mechanisms based on mission parameters.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integration with Ground Control Systems (GCS) for live monitoring of drone status, location, and mission progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Flight controller firmware (e.g., [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/), [PX4](https://px4.io/))
  - [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) for sensor and control system integration
  - Ground Control Software (e.g., [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/), [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/))
  - Python for scripting autonomous missions and telemetry management
  - C++ for integration with ROS nodes and custom flight algorithms

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-powered-drone-software.git
   ```

2. **Set up ROS Environment**:
   - Install ROS:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-desktop-full
     ```
   - Initialize ROS workspace:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
     cd ~/catkin_ws/
     catkin_make
     source devel/setup.bash
     ```

3. **Install Ground Control Software**:
   - Install QGroundControl:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install qgroundcontrol
     ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies** (for telemetry and mission control):
   ```bash
   pip install dronekit pymavlink
   ```

### Software Structure

- **Autonomous Navigation**: ROS nodes for GPS waypoint navigation and path optimization.
- **Flight Control**: Interfaces with flight controller firmware (e.g., via MAVLink protocol) for flight execution.
- **Power Management**: ROS topics for monitoring and managing energy consumption.
- **Payload Management**: Script to control servo mechanisms for payload release.
- **Telemetry and Monitoring**: Real-time data handling through ROS for communication with the GCS.

### Running the Software

1. **Start ROS Nodes**:
   - For navigation, power management, and payload handling:
     ```bash
     roslaunch drone_control autonomous_flight.launch
     ```

2. **Monitor Telemetry**:
   - Use Ground Control Software (e.g., QGroundControl or Mission Planner) to view live data from the drone.

3. **Run Autonomous Missions**:
   - Use Python scripts to initiate and monitor autonomous delivery missions:
     ```bash
     python mission_control.py
     ```

### Development Focus

- **Navigation Algorithms**: Improve the path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Telemetry Integration**: Streamline communication between the drone and ground control.
- **Energy Optimization**: Develop strategies to maximize flight time using solar power.
